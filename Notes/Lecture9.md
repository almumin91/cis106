**Looping**

• It is used to perform a set of command repeatedly.

• Shell scripting support different types of loops:

o For loop

o While loop

o Until loop

• **For loop: repeats the commands between do and done a specified number of time.**

• **Until loop: repeats the command between do and done as long as the tested condition is false**

**(exit status code is greater than 0 (zero)- in other words, until the condition is true.**
