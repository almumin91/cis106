# HomeWork 2: Research free software/open source software alternatives

## Part 1
 
#### 1. There are many  advantages of Open Source Software. One of them is that it's free, unlike closed source. It has lesser hardware cost and high quality software. The source code can be accessed when using Open Source software. I can have more freedom using Open Source and I would not have to worry about licensing. I can also get support from communities if there's any issue with my program.

#### 2. The following 4 essential freedom makes a software open source. 
   - Freedom to have access to the source code and run the program as one desire for any purpose
   - The freedom to study/know how the program works so you can add things, make changes
   - The freedom to redistribute copies when there
   - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified version so that you can help others. 

#### 3. People should use open source software instead of proprietary source because open source is free. It gives people to run the program as they wish and have access to the source code. Using open source software people can modify their code, share with other people, discuss if there's any  and work on the bugs to make the program better. People deserve to control their own program.



#### 4. I agree with Richard Stallman  about the importance of free software. According to him, free software is when the users have control over the software. I believe users deserve to have control over their own computing and run the computing as they wish, have the freedom to make changes, redistribute or working with others  with or without making changes. Also, using a free software group of people can work together and benefit everyone. A lot of people might not know how to do the computing but many others who are studying should not be misssing the opportunity to have freedom over their own computing. Thats why nowadays it is very important to use free software.
