## Deliverable 2
# Resource to use
1. **I used information from these websites article and videos to complete my project:**

   robertalberto.com/linuxcommands/home.html.

   https://linuxhint.com/ubuntu_20-04_google_chrome_installation_guide/.

   https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-libreoffice-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-desktop. 

2. **I learned how to use Virtual machine, particularly the Oracle VirtualBox machine. I have learned how to setup everything for virtualization.**

3. **As I create a virtual machine, there was no need of any hardware except mt laptop. I used the ubuntu ISO file located in my local disk to install it**.
   
4. **As I am doing the default project, there was not any difficulties because I already did the setup few times before. I cannot remember every problem from back then, but one of them was making the VM fullscreen which was not working for me. After several tries and getting help, I was able to fix that problem by installing the guest addition image using terminal command.**
